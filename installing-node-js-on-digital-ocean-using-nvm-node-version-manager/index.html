    <main><h1>Installing Node.js on DigitalOcean using NVM (Node Version Manager)</h1>
<p>Node.js is a popular, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that is used for building scalable, high-performance applications. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to install Node.js on a DigitalOcean droplet using NVM (Node Version Manager), a popular tool for managing multiple Node.js versions on a single machine.</p>
<p>Before you begin, you'll need to have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A DigitalOcean account and a droplet with a fresh installation of Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Access to a terminal on your droplet, either through the DigitalOcean control panel or by using an SSH client.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing Node.JS</h3>
<p>To install NVM on your droplet, you'll need to run a series of commands in your terminal. Start by logging into your droplet using the terminal or an SSH client.</p>
<p>Download <code>NVM</code> via curl and install it.</p>
<pre><code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
</code></pre>
<p>After the installation is complete, you'll need to run the following command to load the NVM environment variables into your shell:</p>
<pre><code>export NVM_DIR=&quot;$HOME/.nvm&quot;
  [ -s &quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \. &quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh&quot;  # This loads nvm
  [ -s &quot;$NVM_DIR/bash_completion&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \. &quot;$NVM_DIR/bash_completion&quot;  # This loads nvm bash_completion
</code></pre>
<p>Restart your terminal</p>
<pre><code>source ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>
<p>Install Node.js's latest <code>lts</code> version</p>
<pre><code>nvm install --lts
</code></pre>
<p>To install a specific version of Node.js, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>nvm install &lt;version&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Replace <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> with the version number of Node.js that you want to install.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have installed a specific version of Node.js, you can switch to that version by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>nvm use &lt;version&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Again replace <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> with the version number of Node.js that you want to install.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By using NVM, you can easily manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single machine, making it easier to switch between different versions as needed. With Node.js installed, you are ready to start building your next great application!</p>
