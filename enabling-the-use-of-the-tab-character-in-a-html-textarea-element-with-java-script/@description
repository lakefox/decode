How to enable the use of the tab character in a HTML textarea element using JavaScript. It describes the process of adding an event listener to the textarea element that listens for the keydown event and checking the keyCode property of the event object to determine if the tab key has been pressed. If the tab key has been pressed, the default behavior of the tab key is prevented and a tab character is inserted into the textarea element using the insertText function. An example of the code required to implement this functionality is also provided.
