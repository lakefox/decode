# JSDoc Setup Guide
JSDoc is a popular tool used to generate documentation for JavaScript code. It allows developers to document their code in a standardized format, making it easier for others to understand and use their code.

Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up JSDoc for your JavaScript project:

### Install JSDoc
You can install JSDoc using npm (the Node.js package manager). Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
npm install -g jsdoc
```

This command will install JSDoc globally on your system, so you can use it for any JavaScript project.

### Create a JSDoc configuration file
JSDoc requires a configuration file to specify how the documentation should be generated. Create a new file named jsdoc.json in the root directory of your project, and add the following code:

```
{
  "source": {
    "include": ["./src"],
    "includePattern": ".+\\.js(doc)?$",
    "excludePattern": "(^|\\/|\\\\)_"
  },
  "opts": {
    "destination": "./docs",
    "recurse": true
  },
  "plugins": [
    "plugins/markdown"
  ],
  "markdown": {
    "parser": "gfm",
    "hardwrap": true
  },
  "templates": {
    "cleverLinks": false,
    "monospaceLinks": false
  }
}
```

This configuration file tells JSDoc to generate documentation for all JavaScript files in the `./src` directory, and save the output in the `./docs` directory. It also specifies that JSDoc should use the markdown plugin to support Markdown syntax in the documentation, and specifies some options for the Markdown parser.

### Add JSDoc comments to your code
JSDoc uses special comments in your code to generate documentation. These comments start with the `/**` characters and contain tags that describe the code element being documented.

For example, here's how you can document a JavaScript function using JSDoc comments:

```
/**
 * Add two numbers together.
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In this example, the `@param` tag is used to document the function's parameters, and the `@returns` tag is used to document the return value.

### Generate the documentation
To generate the documentation, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
```

This command tells JSDoc to use the jsdoc.json configuration file to generate the documentation. The output will be saved in the `./docs` directory (as specified in the configuration file).

That's it! You should now have a set of documentation files generated by JSDoc for your JavaScript project. You can open the `index.html` file in the `./docs` directory in a web browser to view the documentation.
