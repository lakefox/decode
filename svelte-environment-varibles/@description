Environment variables are values that can be passed to an application at runtime, that influence the behavior or configuration of the application. They are stored in key-value pairs and can be used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or configuration settings. This information is made available to the application through the operating system, so the application can use it without having to hardcode the values into the codebase.
