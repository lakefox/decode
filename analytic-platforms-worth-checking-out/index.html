<p>A list of Google Analytics alternatives that can be self hosted.</p>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Google Analytics allows you to track your website's demographics and reach. It is a free tool provided by Google to help its publishers create better content by knowing who they are targeting. Whether you are concerned about privacy or want more features, here we will lay out some great alternatives with a few that are free and open source.</p>

<h3>Fathom</h3>
<h5>Price: $14/m (Up to 100,000 monthly page views)</h5>
<p>Fathom started as an analytics product focused on privacy and simplicity without compromising any features you would have with Google Analytics. Fathom does not track individual users by anonymizing all telemetry data sent to its servers. It is GDPR compliant by default, and only collects the data it needs.</p>

<h3>Matomo</h3>
<h5>Price: Free</h5>
<p>Matomo is a self-hosted analytics platform that is GDPR and CCPA-compliant. All data collected by Matomo is stored on your server using an MYSQL database. It uses the User-Agent, and its custom Universal Device Detection library to detect the browser, operating system, device used (desktop, tablet, mobile, tv, cars, console, etc. ), brand, and model. Along with IP geolocation and page data, Matomo can have custom signals sent to it from your code using its JS library.</p>

<h3>Umami</h3>
<p>Umami is another self-hosted analytics platform with privacy-focused features backed in. It can be easily installed on a Vercel instance with a planet-scale MQSQL database. It offers a very similar user experience to Google Analytics. This is the platform DECODE uses for analytics. Umami is a fully GDPR-compliant platform and uses zero cookies for tracking. It is currently being actively developed and is a great place to start if you have no experience with analytics.</p>
