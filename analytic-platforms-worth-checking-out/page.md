### Fathom

##### Price: $14/m (Up to 100,000 monthly page views)

Fathom started as an analytics product focused on privacy and simplicity without compromising any features you would have with Google Analytics. Fathom does not track individual users by anonymizing all telemetry data sent to its servers. It is GDPR compliant by default, and only collects the data it needs.

### Matomo

##### Price: Free

Matomo is a self-hosted analytics platform that is GDPR and CCPA-compliant. All data collected by Matomo is stored on your server using an MYSQL database. It uses the User-Agent, and its custom Universal Device Detection library to detect the browser, operating system, device used (desktop, tablet, mobile, tv, cars, console, etc. ), brand, and model. Along with IP geolocation and page data, Matomo can have custom signals sent to it from your code using its JS library.
