CSS pseudo elements allow web developers to add specific elements to their webpages without having to write additional HTML or JavaScript. These elements are created by adding a colon and a keyword to the end of a CSS selector. Some of the most commonly used pseudo elements are :before and :after which can be used to add content before or after an element, :first-letter which can be used to style the first letter of a paragraph, and :hover which can be used to add interactive effects when a user hovers their mouse over an element.
