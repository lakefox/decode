    <main><h1>Svelte Stores</h1>
<p>Svelte stores are an important feature of the Svelte framework that enables the sharing of state between components. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Svelte stores.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let's define what a store is in Svelte. A store is an object that holds a piece of reactive state. When the state in the store changes, any component that has subscribed to the store will be automatically updated.</p>
<p>There are two types of stores in Svelte: <code>writable</code> and <code>readable</code> stores. A writable store allows you to update the value of the store, while a readable store only allows you to read the value of the store.</p>
<p>Now, let's dive into the steps for using Svelte stores:</p>
<h3>Import the stores module</h3>
<p>The first step is to import the stores module from Svelte.</p>
<pre><code>import { writable, readable } from 'svelte/store';
</code></pre>
<h3>Create a writable store</h3>
<p>To create a writable store, call the writable function and pass in the initial value of the store. Here is an example of creating a writable store with an initial value of 0:</p>
<pre><code>const count = writable(0);
</code></pre>
<h3>Update the writable store</h3>
<p>To update the value of the writable store, call the set method on the store and pass in the new value. Here is an example of updating the count store:</p>
<pre><code>count.set(1);
</code></pre>
<p>To receive updates when the value of the writable store changes, you can subscribe to the store by calling the subscribe method and passing in a function that will be called with the new value of the store whenever it changes. Here is an example of subscribing to the count store:</p>
<pre><code>count.subscribe(value =&gt; {
  console.log(value);
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Create a readable store</h3>
<p>To create a readable store, call the readable function and pass in an object with a subscribe method. Here is an example of creating a readable store:</p>
<pre><code>const theme = readable({
  primary: 'blue',
  secondary: 'green',
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Subscribe to the readable store</h3>
<p>To receive updates when the value of the readable store changes, you can subscribe to the store by calling the subscribe method and passing in a function that will be called with the current value of the store. Here is an example of subscribing to the theme store:</p>
<pre><code>theme.subscribe(value =&gt; {
  console.log(value.primary);
});
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! You now know how to use writable and readable Svelte stores. Use these stores to share state between components in your Svelte applications.</p>
