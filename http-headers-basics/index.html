    <main><h1>HTTP Headers - Basics</h1>
<p>HTTP headers are a crucial part of the HTTP protocol, which is used to transmit data over the internet. These headers are used to provide additional information about the request or response, such as the type of content being sent, the length of the content, and the encoding used.</p>
<p>There are several types of HTTP headers, each with its own specific purpose. Some of the most common headers include:</p>
<p><code>Content-Type</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This header specifies the type of content being sent, such as text, HTML, or JSON. It is used by the browser to determine how to handle incoming data.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Content-Length</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This header indicates the length of the content being sent, in bytes. It is used by the browser to determine when all of the data has been received.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Accept</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This header is used to specify the types of content that the client is willing to accept. It can be used to specify a specific type of content, such as HTML, or a general type, such as text.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Authorization</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This header is used to provide authentication information, such as a username and password when making a request.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>User-Agent</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This header is used to identify the client making the request. It can be used to determine the type of browser or device being used.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Referer</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This header is used to indicate the URL of the page that made the request. It is commonly used to track the path of a user as they navigate through a website.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Cookie</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This header is used to send cookies from the client to the server, and vice versa. Cookies are small text files that are used to store information about a user, such as their preferences or login status.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these headers, there are many other headers that can be used to provide additional information about the request or response. For a full list of HTTP headers <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">check here</a>. Understanding these headers and how to use them can be essential when developing web applications and services.</p>
<p>In summary, HTTP headers are important for providing additional information about the request and response in HTTP protocol. They can be used for specifying content types, providing authentication information, identifying the client, and more.</p>
