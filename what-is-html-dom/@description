The HTML Document Object Model (DOM) is an integral part of web development and is used to create dynamic web pages. It is a hierarchical tree-like structure that contains the content of the webpage, making it possible for developers to access and manipulate the content. Each element of the webpage is a node, with a unique ID and a set of attributes. The root node of the DOM tree is the HTML element, and all other elements of the webpage are descendants of the HTML element.
