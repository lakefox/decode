GitHub Pages is a free service offered by GitHub that allows you to create a website or blog for your project, personal brand, or business. By default, GitHub Pages provides a subdomain for your site, such as username.github.io. However, you can also use a custom domain name for your site, which can help you establish your brand and make your site more memorable.
