Loops are one of the most valuable tools in any programmer's arsenal, and Javascript is no exception. Loops allow you to execute the same code multiple times with different values, making them a great way to deal with repetitive tasks. There are three main types of loops in Javascript: for loops, while loops, and do-while loops, each with its own syntax and usage.
