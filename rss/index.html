    <title>Promises VS Callbacks</title>
    <link>https://decode.sh/./promises-vs-callbacks</link>
    <description>Promises and callbacks are both ways to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript. A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed after the first function has been completed. A Promise is an object that is returned immediately, representing a value that may not be available yet. Promises are more powerful than callbacks because they provide a way to compose asynchronous operations and methods to handle errors. Promises also provide better readability and maintainability by eliminating the need for nested code blocks.</description>
